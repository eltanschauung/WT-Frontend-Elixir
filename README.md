# WhaleChat

This is the Chat app for Whaletracker ported to Elixir for concurrency and realtime speeds. You can interact with a demo running on Pheonix, connected to the real database: http://173.255.237.230:4001/
Porting the rest of Whaletracker's frontend to Elixir and Phoenix may be soon to follow.
